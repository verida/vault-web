The code in vault-common is deprecated and should not be used.

As of creating this README, nothing in the codebase actually uses it.

That being said, some part of the code could be interesting to look at for inspiration.

Once some of the code has been extracted and used properly in the main implementation, the whole vault-common folder and code can be deleted.
